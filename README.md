# Animalia

### Raising awareness about the animals around us
Animalia is a two-player, rapid-paced educational game that teaches facts about various animals. A random question will be selected, and the first to answer correctly gets the point. The person with the most points after 9 questions wins.

### About the Project
Ethan, Matthew, Pratham, and Priyam started this as a way to educate young generations on the importance of biodiversity and the conservation of animals. This game allows people to learn about animals in a way that will show them in a new light. They believe that by introducing this game early on, people may be able to empathize with animals and prevent their endangerment and extinction.

### Features
Animalia is written in Python 3 and JavaScript. It utilizes CockroachDB as a database backend, Bootstrap for front-end style, and Flask as the serving web server.

Some features of the app itself include:

- Real-time feedback during games, built using websockets
- Profiles and accounts to keep track of a player's game history
- A competitive rating system that pits users against each other on a leaderboard
- As a bonus, the front page contains many facts about endangered species to help fulfill our goal of education about animals.
